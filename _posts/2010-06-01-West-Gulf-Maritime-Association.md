Organized in 1968, the West Gulf Maritime Association succeeded former local maritime associations in Houston, Galveston and Brownsville, Texas. The West Gulf Maritime Association embraced within one non-profit association the membership of steamship owners, operators, agents along with stevedoring, and terminal companies located in all Texas ports and the Port of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Today the Association has grown to over 200 members.

We negotiate and administer various multi-employer collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshoremen’s Association in West Gulf ports. The West Gulf Maritime Association provides payroll, payroll support services, and processes grievances for stevedores operating under the collective bargaining agreements. In addition, we coordinate the training of longshore workers to promote a safe and efficient working environment.

The West Gulf Maritime Association communicates and coordinates with various governmental entities throughout the West Gulf. We also provide a forum for discussions and exchange of information between member companies. Our Daily Industry Update Report also provides members with information impacting our industry.

Through a wide variety of services, the West Gulf Maritime Association is an active advocate and liaison for the maritime industry.
