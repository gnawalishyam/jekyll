## Abstract
Global population growth forecasts require food production to increase by 60% by 2050. Consumers increasingly demand fresh produce that can be proven to have been produced safely according to ethical and sustainable methods. Producers, manufacturers, distributors, carriers, logistics providers and retailers need to boost efficiency and improve supply chain traceability - especially in light of recent safety scares and recalls. This presentation draws on recent research by Chain Business Insights and will set the food supply chain scene, highlight the complex and unique challenges of food logistics, and drill down on recent blockchain pilots that are addressing current shortcomings and challenges of the global food supply chain ecosystem.
