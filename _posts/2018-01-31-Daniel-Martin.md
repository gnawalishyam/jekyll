Daniel Martin has spent his working life in finance, operations and business development roles throughout the US and Latin America. After graduating with a dual MBA & Master of Global Management from The University of Houston & Thunderbird School of Global Management, Daniel worked as a proposals manager for Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) where he provided financial oversight on many international engineering projects totaling billions of dollars in costs. Daniel then relocated to Panama and joined CBRE, the world’s largest real estate brokerage firm. As senior consultant, Daniel was exposed to several large agricultural transactions and, as a result, decided to pursue sustainable agricultural trade. His initial agricultural venture included a high-pressure processing facility in Guatemala that was acquired in 2017.
