Previously the Vice President of Business Development APAC at Agility Logistics and the Head of Consumer Retail Asia at DHL, Max has over 10 years’ executive business development experience with leading logistics service providers in Asia, solving board-level supply chain problems for multinationals focused on the retail and consumer goods industries.

Prior, Max spent approximately 10 years in the I.T. arena at multiple “dot-com” start-ups in California’s Silicon Valley, trained as a systems engineer and worked for product development software companies in the US and Europe, before entering the logistics industry as a software product manager at APL Logistics in 2000.

Max is originally from the US, and holds an MBA from the Thunderbird School of Global Management. Max is thus one of the few individuals in the industry with a combination of technical I.T. knowledge and commercial sales management experience, and a true passion for combining the two in this exciting time for the logistics industry.

## Abstract

**Blockchain-Powered Trucking: Using Irrefutable Records to Drive Cash Flow and Liquidity**


OpenPort is using blockchain technology to accelerate the cash flow in supply chains. Micro-rewards incentivise compliance and data sharing, with shipment events recorded on a decentralised ledger, proving exactly what was delivered, when, and by whom. With an instant and irrefutable proof of delivery, the speed and reliability of payments between parties is greatly enhanced.
