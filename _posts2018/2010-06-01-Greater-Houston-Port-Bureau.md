The Greater Houston Port Bureau is a member-driven non-profit trade organization dedicated to promoting the maritime industry. Founded in 1929, the Greater Houston Port Bureau has been fostering communication and information about the Port of Houston, the Houston Ship Channel, and the maritime industry to constituents both in and out of the port region for almost 90 years. With over 200 member companies, and under the leadership of a board of directors comprised of executives from leading companies directly in and affiliated with the maritime industry, the Port Bureau provides four core services to members, maritime stakeholders, and the community at large: vessel information, port information, networking, and advocacy.
