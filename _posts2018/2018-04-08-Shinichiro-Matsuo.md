## Abstract

**How academia can help maturing blockchain technology and ecosystem.**

Blockchain technology is thought to become a decentralized social foundation like the Internet. Many experimental projects are now expanding the possibility of flexile ecosystem come from Blockchain technology. As we experienced in the development of the Internet technology and its ecosystem, academic work can help maturing this kind of fundamental technology. In this talk, I introduce an initiative called BSafe.network, which is a natural research test network for Blockchain technology and play the same role which NSFNet and BSD played to maturing the Internet technology. Then, how such academic research can facilitate future blockchain applications and flexible ecosystem including smart supply chain, with introducing some examples of projects.
