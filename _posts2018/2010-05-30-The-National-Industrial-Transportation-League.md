As the nation’s premier freight transportation association, the League’s mission is “to advance the views of shippers on freight transportation issues and enhance their professional development.” From its beginnings in 1907, when economic regulation ruled our industry, though the present, the League has been at the forefront of changes that have helped shape our nation’s commercial freight transportation system. Across modes, the League has been a proven leader in representing shippers’ interests. The League is well-positioned to engage all sectors of the industry to develop a modern, safe, and efficient freight transportation system, which meets our country’s commercial needs both domestically and internationally.
