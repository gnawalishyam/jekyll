## Abstract

**Supply Chains and Blockchains - Driving Economic Impact and Fairer Trade**

The true economic impact of blockchain, IoT and cryptocurrency innovation will be driven through supply chain. While the evolution of fintech is important, the $54T global supply chain and logistics market, which encompasses two-thirds of the worldâ€™s economy, offers even greater opportunities to make a positive impact on global GDP and produce better outcomes for companies and individuals throughout the value chain.

Blockchain use cases for supply chain will support all aspects of the design, production and delivery of goods to meet customer needs. Even more interestingly, supply chains have operated as decentralized economic organizations for centuries, often with their own forms of shared ledgers and trade currency. The value of blockchain technology combined with other innovations now offers us a means for increasing liquidity, freeing working capital and easing settlement in today's global supply chains that will benefit world economies, and the people working within them.
