The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark opened a new Consulate in Houston, Texas, at the beginning of the year and had its opening reception two weeks ago with Ministers, Congressmen, City Representatives and over 300 guests attending the opening ceremony alone.

Unlike what many think, the Danish Consulates in the US are very commercial in their focus and help improve the commercial ties between Danish and American companies. The new Consulate in Texas had therefore also arranged industry-focused events within Wind, Water and Maritime in collaboration with local Texan partners. Besides these industry sectors, the Consulate’s strategy is also to become involved in Health/Life Science, Waste Management & Biogas as well as Innovation/Technology.

The Danish Consulate in Texas is therefore happy to support XChain2’s event on blockchain as this technology certainly will play an important role going forward, influencing multiple industries where Denmark is heavily involved, e.g. Shipping, Logistics and Energy.

Besides the Embassy in Washington D.C., Denmark has Consulates in Silicon Valley, Chicago, New York and now Houston, employing both Americans and Danes who work in an industry-specialized matrix across the US.
