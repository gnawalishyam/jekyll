									<b>Supply Chains and Blockchains - Driving Economic Impact and Fairer Trade</b></br><a href="person2018/Jason-English">Jason English</a></br><em>Vice President of Protocol Marketing</em></br><em>Sweetbridge</em></br></br>The true economic impact of blockchain and IoT will be driven through supply chain. While the evolution of Fintech is important, the $54T global supply chain and logistics market, which encompasses two-thirds of the world’s economy, offers even greater opportunities to make a positive impact on global GDP and produce better outcomes for companies and individuals throughout the value chain. Blockchain use cases for supply chain will support all aspects of the design, production and delivery of goods to meet customer needs. Even more interestingly, supply chains have operated as decentralized economic organizations for centuries, often with their own forms of shared ledgers. The value of blockchain technology combined with other innovations now offers us a means for increasing liquidity, freeing working capital and easing settlements in today’s global supply chains that will benefit world economies, and the people working within them.</br></br><b>From Lineage to Safety: Chewing on Blockchain’s Application to the Food Industry</b></br><a href="person2018/Daniel-Martin">Matthew DiBona</a></br><em>Senior Director</em></br><em>Smartbridge</em></br></br>Blockchain use cases abound in all industries, and the recent food safety recalls underscore the promise of blockchain to the food industry value chain. During this session, Matthew DiBona will review several of the noteworthy opportunities for blockchain in the food industry, then will demonstrate a Smartbridge mobile application built to facilitate the physical and digital handoff of goods along food value chain participants, including integrating the Ethereum blockchain to backend enterprise applications.</br></br><b>Using Smart Contracts to Connect Producers and Buyers</b></br><a href="person2018/Daniel-Martin">Daniel Martin</a></br><em>Chief Operation Officer</em></br><em>Producers Market</em></br></br>Today, larger industry players cause producers to get only a fraction of the retail value of their produce. Imagine using smart contracts where an online marketplace can cut out the intermediaries so producers can go direct to market, even though those markets 1000's of miles away. The speaker will cover the financial market aspects of using smart contracts to facilitate trade with agriculture producers and the benefits of blockchain.

									<b>Session 12: Keynote Address: Blockchain – A Government Perspective</b></br></br>Blockchain as a technology is capable of achieving a global view of the supply chain and visibility without using traditional centralized infrastructure, it holds many promises to improving efficiencies and ensuring compliance in commercial customs and implementation of a single window. COAC Global Supply Chain Subcommittee established an Emerging Technologies Working Group to look into the applicability of blockchain to trade processing. In Nov, 2017, the workgroup came up with 14 use cases including capturing and keeping track of partnering government agencies licenses, permits, certificate of origin reporting and free trade agreement product qualifications, carnets and bonded movement tracking. </br></br>Subsequent deep-dive efforts with members of the trade community in early 2018, further resulting in three use cases of blockchain for trade: automation of paper processing tied to certification of origin to qualify for free trade agreements including NAFTA (current process is to validate post-audit, time consuming and cumbersome); automation of Carnets; Partner Government Agency (PGA) licenses, certifications, and permits with a focus on tuna form to automate an interagency paper process.

									<b>Session 14: Off the Chain! Network SaaS Platforms and Blockchain: What Belongs On-Chain vs. Off-Chain</b></br></br>We will discuss the high cost and performance limitations of existing blockchain technology and why the majority of blockchain applications for supply chain will not be blockchain alone, but a combination of blockchain integrated with other technologies: supply chain optimization and execution applications, network analytics, traditional databases, workflow, global trade services, etc. These will leverage the decades of development, deployment, and best practice refinement in existing supply chain systems and applications. The talk will cover Network SaaS Architecture and examples of platforms, existing supply chain technologies being combined with blockchain, and how decisions are being made about which functionality and data belongs on the blockchain vs. off the blockchain.

									<b>Session 16: Fueling the Future of the Petrochemical Industry</b></br></br>There are huge interests from the petrochemical industry concerning Blockchain. An article published on March 1st by Energy Post claims “the next oil boom will be fueled by blockchain”. A number of blockchain platforms focusing on petrochemical and energy industry have been developed and some have been tested in recent pilots. For instance, a pilot project involving BP, Eni and Wien Energie demonstrated how a blockchain platform could automate trade reconciliation processes using smart contracts. Through collaboration with Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ), a blockchain-based platform was developed to improve transparency, efficiency, government reporting and compliance. Other efforts include Petrobloq’s PetroBLOQ blockchain platform developed exclusively for the supply chain needs of the Oil &amp; Gas sector. A BP, Shell and Statoil-backed oil-trading consortium to modernize physical energy post-trade processes using blockchain technology also caught huge market interests. In this session, blockchain and petrochemical experts will present how blockchain may transform the future of Oil &amp; Gas industry.

Supply chain processes in Oil & Gas industry are extremely laborious and prone to human error, and can be a perfect start for a company that wants to begin implementing blockchain technology in its operations. There are multiple ways to apply supply chain tools, and I will be talking specifically about processes that have been implemented by ConsenSys and leading enterprises.
